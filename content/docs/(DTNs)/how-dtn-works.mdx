The **Decentralized Transaction Network (DTN)** is the backbone of the Okto Layer, automating and coordinating complex multi-chain transactions. This page dives into the technical details of how DTNs operate, including their architecture, workflow, and key components.

## DTN Architecture

The DTN is designed to handle multi-chain transactions efficiently and securely. Below is a diagram illustrating its architecture:

### Key Components of the DTN Architecture

1. **User Interface (UI)**: The frontend interface where users initiate multi-chain transactions (e.g., swapping, bridging, staking).

2. **Okto Gateway**: The entry point for user requests. It validates and forwards requests to the DTN.

3. **Job Scheduler**: Breaks down user requests into smaller subtasks and schedules them for execution.

4. **Task Executor**: Executes each subtask in the correct sequence, ensuring all steps are completed efficiently.

5. **Okto Chain**: Logs each step of the transaction, providing a transparent and immutable record of the process.

6. **Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)**: Handles secure signing of transactions using MPC-based security.

7. **Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)**: Provides efficient cross-chain swaps and liquidity access.

## DTN Workflow

The DTN simplifies multi-chain transactions by automating the entire process. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of its workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### User Request

    A user initiates a multi-chain transaction (e.g., swapping tokens on Ethereum, bridging them to BNB Chain, and staking them).

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Job Creation

    The request is logged as a **job** on the Okto Chain, which defines the user’s intent and the steps required to achieve it.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Task Breakdown

    The DTN breaks the job into smaller subtasks, such as:

    - Swapping tokens on the source chain.
    - Bridging tokens to the destination chain.
    - Staking tokens on the destination chain.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Execution

    The DTN executes each subtask in the correct sequence, ensuring that all steps are completed efficiently.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### On-Chain Logging

    Each step of the transaction is logged on the Okto Chain, providing a transparent and immutable record of the process.

  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Completion

    The user receives the final result (e.g., staked tokens on the destination chain) without needing to manage each step manually.

  </Step>
</Steps>

  **Did You Know?** The DTN’s asynchronous capabilities allow it to handle
  transactions across multiple chains, even if they occur at different times.
