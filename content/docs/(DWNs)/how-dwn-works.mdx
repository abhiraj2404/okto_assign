Decentralized Wallet Networks (DWNs) are the backbone of the Okto Layer’s wallet experience, providing users with a seamless and secure method to interact with multiple blockchains. The DWN simplifies the process by enabling users to access various blockchain networks with a single unified wallet. But how exactly do DWNs make this possible?

## The DWN Architecture

At the core of DWNs is a decentralized network of nodes that manage wallet keys using advanced cryptographic techniques. Let’s break down how this works in a typical DWN setup:

- **Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**: Rather than relying on a single entity to hold and sign a wallet’s private key, the DWN employs MPC. This means the private key is never fully constructed or stored on a single node. Instead, multiple nodes collaborate to generate a cryptographic signature, ensuring decentralized control and security.
- **Threshold Signature Scheme (TSS)**: In this scheme, multiple signers are involved in creating a signature for transactions, but only a predefined number of nodes (a threshold) need to collaborate to approve it. In Okto’s DWN, the system follows a 11/20 threshold, meaning that 11 out of 20 nodes must collaborate to approve a transaction.

- **Delegated MPC Signers**: The DWN uses a network of MPC signers, connected through the EigenLayer AVS (Actively Validated Services). These signers are responsible for securely handling wallet keys and approving transactions.

- **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)**: Each MPC node runs inside a secure enclave, known as a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). TEEs add an additional layer of security by isolating the execution of sensitive data from the rest of the system, preventing unauthorized access to wallet keys.

## How DWNs Handle Transactions

When you initiate a transaction through a DWN, here’s the flow that happens:

1. **User Request**: A user makes a request, such as sending tokens or interacting with a smart contract.
2. **Transaction Authorization**: The DWN checks the user's request and verifies if it aligns with the permissions associated with their wallet. Once validated, the transaction proceeds to the signing process.

3. **Signature Creation**: The DWN sends the transaction to its network of MPC signers. These signers collaboratively compute the necessary cryptographic signature.

4. **Threshold Approval**: The transaction is approved once the required threshold (e.g., 11 out of 20 signers) is reached, ensuring decentralized control and security.

5. **Transaction Execution**: After obtaining the signature, the transaction is forwarded to the relevant blockchain for execution.

## Security in DWNs

Security is a critical concern when dealing with wallets and private keys. The DWN architecture ensures that:

- **No Single Point of Failure**: Since the private keys are never stored in one place and the signing process requires multiple nodes to collaborate, DWNs eliminate the risk of a single point of failure or centralized control.

- **Key Management**: By using MPC and TSS, DWNs ensure that keys are only ever partially revealed, significantly reducing the risk of compromise.

- **Tamper-Resistant**: Each signing operation is validated across multiple nodes, and each transaction is logged for verification on the Okto Chain, ensuring that the process is transparent and tamper-resistant.

## User Experience with DWNs

The beauty of DWNs lies in the user experience. Instead of juggling different wallets for each blockchain, the DWN allows users to:

- **Unified Wallet**: Access and manage assets across multiple blockchains with a single wallet.
- **Easy Onboarding**: Users can log in via everyday methods (Google, Facebook, etc.), bypassing the need for seed phrases or hardware wallets.
- **Seamless Multi-Chain Operations**: Execute transactions across chains without needing to manually switch wallets or worry about different blockchain ecosystems.
