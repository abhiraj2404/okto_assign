title: Overview of Okto Chain
---

The **Okto Chain** is a specialized **ZK-based Layer 2 chain** built on **Polygon CDK**. It serves as the **trustless coordination layer** for the Okto ecosystem, ensuring transparency, decentralization, and efficiency. Unlike traditional blockchains, the Okto Chain is not designed to compete with major networks like Ethereum or Solana. Instead, it acts as a **command center**, coordinating all activities within the Okto Layer.

## What is the Okto Chain?

The Okto Chain is a **ZK-rollup** that provides a secure and efficient environment for coordinating multi-chain transactions. It acts as the **glue** that holds the Okto Layer together, ensuring that all components—such as the **Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN)**, **Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL)**, and **Decentralized Transaction Network (DTN)**—work seamlessly.

### Key Features of the Okto Chain

1. **Immutable Ledger**: - Records all jobs, intents, and permissions on-chain, ensuring transparency and trustlessness.
2. **Policy and Permission Management**: - Stores wallet permissions and approved bridging solutions, ensuring secure and compliant operations.
3. **Scalability and Efficiency**: - Built as a ZK-rollup, the Okto Chain can handle high volumes of coordination tasks without bogging down the main chain.
4. **Proof Storage**: - Stores zero-knowledge proofs or hashed data to confirm the actions of the DTN and DWN, preventing tampering or errors.
5. **Stand-Alone Ecosystem**: - Over time, more dApps can integrate the Okto Chain’s features, enabling programmable scripts and advanced use cases.

## Role of the Okto Chain in the Okto Layer

The Okto Chain plays a critical role in the Okto Layer ecosystem by:

1. **Coordinating Transactions**: - The Okto Chain logs all jobs and intents from the DTN, ensuring that multi-chain transactions are executed correctly.

2. **Ensuring Transparency**: - Every action taken by the DWN, ULL, and DTN is recorded on the Okto Chain, providing a transparent and immutable record.

3. **Enforcing Rules**: - The Okto Chain stores policies and permissions, ensuring that all components of the Okto Layer operate within predefined rules.

4. **Enhancing Security**: - By storing proofs and hashed data, the Okto Chain ensures that no single entity can tamper with the system.

## Conclusion

The Okto Chain is the backbone of the Okto Layer, providing a secure, transparent, and efficient way to coordinate multi-chain transactions. By abstracting the complexities of blockchain coordination, the Okto Chain empowers developers to build powerful Web3 applications with ease.
