## What is the Okto Layer?

The Okto Layer is a middleware solution that acts as a universal bridge between diverse blockchains and applications. It simplifies blockchain interactions, handling complex operations like wallet management, liquidity access, and transaction coordination.

Core components of the Okto Layer include:

1. **Decentralized Wallet Networks (DWNs):** Unified, secure wallet management across multiple chains.
2. **Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL):** Efficient cross-chain swaps with optimized liquidity solutions.
3. **Decentralized Transaction Networks (DTNs):** Automation of multi-chain transactions, reducing user friction.
4. **The Okto Chain:** A ZK-based Layer 2 chain ensuring transparency, decentralization, and coordination.
