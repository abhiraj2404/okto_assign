## Why Okto Layer?

The Okto Layer was designed to overcome some of the most significant challenges in the Web3 ecosystem. With the increasing complexity of decentralized technologies, there’s a critical need for a solution that simplifies the user and developer experience while maintaining the security and decentralization that blockchain promises.

Okto abstracts the complexities of blockchain networks, offering a seamless experience for users and developers. Here's why it's the key to the next evolution in blockchain technology:

### 1. **Chain Abstraction**

Managing multiple blockchains can be a daunting task. With Okto, developers and users no longer need to worry about the complexities of different networks. The Okto Layer simplifies this by acting as a universal bridge between various blockchains and applications, enabling cross-chain interactions without needing deep blockchain-specific knowledge.

### 2. **Streamlined Transaction Management**

In traditional Web3 applications, users must interact with various components to execute a single transaction, paying fees in different tokens, choosing the right network, and ensuring everything goes smoothly. The Okto Layer automates this process, coordinating the multiple steps involved in a transaction, all while saving time and reducing user friction.

### 3. **Efficient Liquidity Access**

Fragmented liquidity across different chains has been a major pain point. Okto’s Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL) aggregates liquidity from different sources, automatically finding the most efficient route for token swaps and cross-chain interactions. This means you can seamlessly access liquidity without the need for managing multiple bridges and liquidity pools.

### 4. **Improved User-Friendliness**

With Okto, Web3 is no longer an intimidating space for non-technical users. Through a unified wallet (DWN), simplified transaction flows, and a user-friendly interface, Okto ensures that even those with little or no blockchain knowledge can interact with the ecosystem effortlessly.

### 5. **Decentralization and Security**

Okto maintains decentralization through its innovative design, with security ensured by the use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) in the Decentralized Wallet Network (DWN) and other secure protocols. By leveraging decentralized principles and a ZK-based layer, Okto ensures that all transactions and data are handled securely and transparently.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User Request via Gateway**: You submit a request via a simple DApp interface, such as transferring tokens or interacting with a DeFi protocol. Okto checks the request for validation.

2. **Job Creation on Okto Chain**: The validated request is sent to the Okto Chain, where it is turned into a "job" that details your goal—e.g., swap tokens or stake assets.

3. **Transaction Orchestration by DTN**: The Decentralized Transaction Network (DTN) breaks down the job into smaller tasks and executes them in the correct order, ensuring everything is done correctly and efficiently.

4. **Liquidity Access via ULL**: The DTN consults the Unified Liquidity Layer (ULL) to find the best cross-chain liquidity solution. The ULL aggregates liquidity from various sources, ensuring the best speed, cost, and security for your transaction.

5. **Transaction Execution**: The DTN coordinates the transaction process, sending the necessary details to the DWN (Decentralized Wallet Network) for secure signing and ensuring the whole process happens seamlessly.

6. **Final Confirmation**: The Okto Chain logs the final results of the transaction for transparency, confirming that the process was executed as intended.
